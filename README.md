This challenge was my third challenge in my online Bootcamp at UC Berkeley Extension.
The goal was to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create A Random Password Generator which would give the use the option to choose a length of a given password, parameters to meet such as whether to include capitals, numbers, and symbols, and lastly would allow the user to copy said generated password for their use.

The below is the user story and acceptance criteria I recieved:

User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security



Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

I am very much still getting the hang of this, but with every challenge I complete my skills and confidence grow.
